## Chapter 1. Introduction and objectives of thesis

Over the past decade, most Western democracies have experienced a renewed surge in support for far-right parties (FRPs). Whereas in 2010 far-right parties accounted for approximately …% of parliamentary seats on average across Europe, this figure has steadily increased, reaching …% by 2025. Once marginal actors at the fringes of political debate, far-right parties have increasingly shaped mainstream political agendas and, in several cases, entered government.

In countries such as the United States, Italy, and Hungary, incumbent governments already reflect this ideological shift. Elsewhere—such as in France, Germany, Portugal, and Spain—far-right parties have experienced substantial electoral gains while remaining outside government. Poland represents a particularly illustrative case: although a center-left coalition assumed power following the 2023 parliamentary elections, the 2025 presidential election demonstrated that conservative and far-right support remains geographically and electorally robust.

In response to these developments, a substantial body of research has emerged seeking to explain the rise of far-right parties. Existing explanations emphasize cultural backlash, demand–supply interactions, and various forms of economic and identity-based voting behavior. While this literature has greatly improved our understanding of the drivers of far-right support, it has paid comparatively less attention to its spatial dimension.

Recent research highlights the political geography of far-right support as a promising direction for future inquiry (Golder, 2016). Although aggregate analyses suggest that far-right support tends to be stronger in rural and historically conservative regions, significant regional variation persists both within and across countries. These spatial patterns remain insufficiently theorized and empirically tested.

Building on this emerging research agenda, this thesis aims to deepen our understanding of the spatial distribution of far-right party support in Europe. Moving beyond descriptive mapping and aggregate-level analyses, the study employs statistical spatial modeling techniques to examine whether and how far-right support is geographically structured, clustered, and evolving over time.

Research hypothesis:
1. Cross-sectional hypotheses:
1.1. Spatial dependence
Far-right party support exhibits significant positive spatial autocorrelation across subnational regions.

1.2. Urban–rural gradient
Far-right party support is systematically lower in urban regions and higher in rural or peripheral regions, controlling for socioeconomic factors.

2. Dynamic hypotheses:
2.1. Temporal polarization
Regions with higher initial levels of far-right support experience greater subsequent increases in vote share, indicating spatial polarization over time.

2.2. Temporal diffusion
Although far-right support is spatially clustered at given points in time, inter-electoral changes in vote shares are not spatially clustered, suggesting that electoral dynamics are not driven by diffusion across neighboring regions.

The thesis is structured as follows. Chapter 2 reviews the current state of research on the third wave of far-right mobilization, focusing on backlash theory, supply–demand interactions, and electoral behavior studies, while highlighting key limitations and open questions. Chapter 3 outlines the theoretical framework, data sources, and methodological approach used in the analysis. Chapter 4 examines the spatial distribution of far-right support in Poland, Germany, Spain, Italy, and France, situating quantitative findings within their respective socio-political contexts. Chapter 5 presents the results, discusses their implications, and outlines directions for future research.

## Chapter 2. Overview of the state of research into the 3rd wave of far right surge

``` {Just a quick overview}
A far-right party is a political group positioned beyond the mainstream right, characterized by core ideologies like nationalism, nativism (favoring native-born citizens), anti-immigration, and xenophobia, often coupled with authoritarian tendencies and anti-establishment rhetoric, challenging liberal-democratic norms and promoting an ethnically or culturally homogenous nation. They differ from traditional conservatives by focusing heavily on identity politics, cultural purity, and opposing multiculturalism, often utilizing populist appeals against "corrupt elites". While both lean right, far-right parties often reject the universalist and egalitarian principles of modern democracy, focusing instead on radical exclusion and preserving specific group identities (race, ethnicity, religion). The term covers a wide range, from radical right-wing populist parties (like France's National Rally) that operate within democratic systems to more extreme groups (neo-fascists, neo-Nazis) aiming to fundamentally alter or undermine democracy itself.
We can identify a few core ideological pillars of far right parties. These are:
- Nativism & Nationalism: Belief that the nation should be exclusively for the "native" group, viewing non-natives as threats, and prioritizing national unity above other values.
- Xenophobia & Anti-Immigration: Strong opposition to immigration, often fueled by fears of cultural dilution or replacement, as seen in the "Great Replacement" theory.
- Authoritarianism: Support for strong executive power, strict social order, and often an illiberal stance that challenges democratic equality and pluralism.
- Anti-Elitism & Populism: Portraying themselves as the true voice of the "people" against corrupt liberal elites, sometimes incorporating anti-communist, anti-Semitic, or homophobic views.
- Cultural Conservatism: Emphasis on traditional values, often linked to preserving a specific ethnic or national identity, leading to "culture wars".

### 2.1.2 Draft note: Demand and supply side factors
``` {Golder M., 2016 Far Right Parties in Europe}
Demand-side arguments emphasize the grievances that make far right parties appealing. I focus
on modernization grievances, economic grievances, and cultural grievances.

Supply-side arguments emphasize the importance
of having a favorable political opportunity structure, a strong party organization, and a winning
ideology.
```

### 2.1 Historical development of far-right parties
Extreme right-wing parties lost their support after World War II, amid being discredited by their support for racism, anti-semitism and authoritarianism. With a few exceptions, Europe had no dealings with such groups until the 1970s. Such a situation could partly be explained by post-war recovery and prosperity. The extensive pre- and redistribution or the labor market policies aiming at full employment meant that the percentage of voters interested in criticizing mainstream parties was marginal.

This situation changed with the advent of the oil crisis in the 1980s, when a wave of radical right-wing political movements appeared in the public debate for the first time since World War II. Deteriorating economic situation, mass migration from conflict areas and unstable political situation led to emergence of groups of people dissatisfied with political establishment. The world became more unstable creating a space for radical right parties to fill and facilitate on those grievances. Far right parties tapped into this new group by focusing on issues such as security, identity and immigration. We need to note, however, that farright parties didn’t manage to gain a significant support to be a victorious party. That happened only in the second decade of 21st century through a Hungarian Fidesz party’s success. This does not indicate that radical right parties have not been present since 80s decade. In fact, the historical record demonstrates that “most radical right parties—and nearly all of the successful ones—have been relatively stable over the past two decades” (Art, 2013).

It's often viewed that the rise of a radical right has resulted from a massive frustration with incumbent politicians, growing resistance to immigration and rising unemployment rates. This perspective, however, lacks clarity and does not include all the intricacies that the topic has faced. Casual observators of the topic miss historical overview on what the situation was before it led to the current establishment of Radical Right Parties (RPP) giving rise to wrong conclusions. A popular belief is based on an idea of a “losers of globalization” i.e. blue-collar workers, people with lower education and the unemployed. Such a notion is claimed mixed and inconclusive (Mols and Jetten, 2020). Inglehart and Norris (2016) found in their analysis of different surveys strongest support for RRPs among the older generation, men, those lacking college education, and people with traditional values. The division by gender also applies on age with young men often being the potential pool of voters (Szelewa i Polakowski, 2017).

Following the described situation the thesis focuses on premise of identifying factors and changes in socio-economic spheres that led to the development of far right parties and eventually their establishment in national governments across European Union Member States. In order to highlight how different aspect are impactful in political parties performance the paper outlines a history behind Fidesz and PiS parties. The paper follows and builds upon research done by David Art (Rise of the Radical Right: Implications for European Politics, 2013) and by Mols and Jetten (Understanding Support for Populist Radical Right Parties: Toward a Model That Captures Both Demand-and Supply-Side Factors, 2020).

### 2.2 The case of Hungary and Poland

In the recent decade we’ve seen an emergence of new wave of far right parties, yet this time their actions proved to be successful in attracting media coverage on voting outcomes. Fidesz, the Hungarian far right party won 2010 elections by a majority with 53% of the vote (Scheppele, 2022). Such a result was partly a result of economic crisis and the aftermath of its impact on hungarian economy as well of a lack of choice among political spectrum- previously run Socialist Party (MSzP), after financial mismanagement, was forced to step aside in favor of a caretaker government took by Liberals Party (LMP) under a harsh IMF austerity program. The Liberals response to tackle arose issues was not seen favorably thus rendering the party as demoralized and unpopular going into the 2010 election. Liberals Party under such conditions failed to run a party list at all. The Socialists on the other hand, amid yet further scandals party officials were found to be involved in, were prepared for defeat. Another party that was founded following the economic turmoil was a radical far right Jobbik yet also this party did not gain a widespread approval as many voters considered it to be too extreme thus looking for other alternatives. This proved to be a perfect ground for Victor Orban’s Fidesz party. Kubas and Czyż (2018) in their analysis highlighted the importance. As classified by PopuList (Rooduijn i inni, 2019) of the discredition of the Socialist Party pointing at those developments as a pivotal point that led Fidesz to victory in 2010’s election. After having been established as a majority party Orban could proceed with undertaking reforms on economic and systemic level. The party swiftly started introducing changes intended to consolidate Orban’s party position and undermine opposition’s efforts to threaten the government. Changes included taking control of the mass media, reforming electoral law, limiting freedom of the Constitutional Tribunal, ascribing increased competences to Prime Minister among others (Scheppele, 2022).

Reforms undergone in the period following the Fidesz full controll over the Hungarian politics guaranteed the government legitimate means to influence the society across even more dimensions. Electoral law was changed to benefit large parties and the media was takenover through “the tactics of filling important positions in the state with people supporting it and removing these who did not support its rule” (Kubas i Czyż, 2018). 2014’s election proved that undertaken changes were sucessful in helping the party to maintain its majority position in the country. The war in Syria and a growing number of people seeking asylum in European Union elevated tensions with the Union. In preparation to next elections Fidesz campaign focused mainly on anti-migration slogans and the foreign meddling with domestic issues. The party using national media constructed an overarching rhetoric of a threat immigrants pose on traditional values and safety. Orban also presented itselft as a “defender of of Hungarian sovereignty” (Kubas i Czyż, 2018) through a notion of a “public enemy”. The statement took its form in a person of Soros, a Hungarian born billionaire, who was portreyed as a representative of the Western thought that aimed to weaken the nation state through the invasion of migrants. As H. Grassegger (2020) explained Orban’s campaign relied on a concept of negative campaigning that is “a type of election campaign in which you prefer to attack an opponent instead of defending your own program”. The tactic proved very effective building on top of previous reforms benefitting the party. 2018 elections ended for Fidesz with yet another majority win.

The case of Hungary points at some factors constituting to a growth in support for right wing parties. Fidesz succesfully used the 2006 scandals that casted a shadow on the established party, later to facilitate on the lacking government’s response toward 2008 crisis. Due to a recalculation of seats procedure set in Hungarian constitution Fidesz and KDNP controlled over 2/3 of seats in the Nugarian National Assembly Reforms conducted after the 2010 win consolidated the power giving the government yet further access to building it’s support base. Events that followed 2015 migration crisis were used to create an enemy that the society opposed.

### 2.3 Drivers of far right development

Following those steps does not, however, guerantee a victory and is not a defnite path to gain momentum and thus support in elections. Deteriorating economic perspective that proceded 2008 financial crisis did not led to an immediate widespread increase in support for far right parties among other EU Member States (Art, 2013). Art adds that “since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, most radical right parties in Europe have performed at or a little below their historical averages”. Only half a decade later far right parties started attracting supporters. Contrary to Art’s insights, however, in a recent research scholars recognized that financial crises do create fertile ground for far right parties to use. They make governing more difficult, irrespective of which parties are in power and thus provide far right parties a situation they can capitilize from (Funke, Schularick i Trebesch, 2015). What’s more, as the analysis found, these effects have become stronger over time. The crisis acted as a catalyst and increased far right parties’ performance all over Europe but it’s spillover effect has been fully enabled when parties could attach their economic struggle based campaigns to socially relevant issues.

Such turn of affairs occurred in Poland with a majority victory of Law and Justice (PiS) in 2015 national elections. The party followed a similar path undertaken before by Hungary grounding it’s narration first on post-crisis economic conditions only later utilizing the concept of ‘public enemy’. There, migrants and opposition party leader and Polish Prime Minister in between 2007 and 2014- Donald Tusk, were projected in the party’s campaign as threats to the Polish nation and its traditions. This rhetoric has followed since then to become even more focused on fostering national values and opposition of foreign powers influence in domestic issues. It needs to be noted, however, that the establishment of the discourse was fully completed only after PiS came to power (when it secured a control over national media’s reflecting Orban’s moves). The party did indeed capitalize on the migration crisis that started in 2014 yet we need to recognize that other factors were essential in securing the victory. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, PiS leader, has focused its campaign on a populistic discourse over the division between ordinary people and a corrupt elite embodied by the opposition led government. The adoption of projected reforms was used to prove a credibility of the rhetoric. Party’s programme was based, among others, on introduction of pro-social policies targetting adversities caused by austerity measures adopted as a result of 2008 financial crisis. Those changes took form in social transfers and benefits targetted at strengthening a conservative ideology based on a traditional role of the family in public life (Kulesza i Rae, january 2017). As we can see the economic component played a major role as well in the Polish case.

As it is visible analyzing the case of Hungary and Poland rise of RRPs similarities emerge and point at the combination of an adequate actions and messaging of the issues that the society perceives. The crucial aspect seems to be placed on a adequate answer amid economic struggles in the society and messages that attract strong and opposing reactions. Through an effective messaging far right actors can elevate and politicize issues previously neglected by mainstream parties.

The use of general term “actors” is not accidental. Parties can capitilize from doubts present across society by creating, organizing and mobilizing public support often linked to that of a social movement. The survival and success of far right parties does not exclusively depend on their electoral success and media savviness but also on a participation of activists (Gattinara i Pirro, 2018). In the aftermath of financial crisis street protests increase dramatically which can in turn negatively impact policy-making in democracies (Funke, Schularick i Trebesch, 2015).

Those supporters, united by the cause, will often follow the party no matter how it performs in other aspects as long as it stands by the narrative. They identify themselves with the party creating a tribal attatchment style. Art notes that “once someone casts a vote for a radical right party, they are likely to continue voting for it” (Art, 2013).

A role of communication in party’s agenda is therefore often pivotal in bringing its messages across the society. We’ve already seen impact media has on forming the discourse. The other often hihlighted element is a role of a “charismatic leadership”. Mols and Jetten (2020) point, however, at the difficulty with a use of the label. People can argue about what constitutes to being charismatic- PiS leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, is not widely considered charismatic afterall. As authors note the term is thus rather “rubbery”. The other problem arises from the fact that some leaders may be charismating in their external appearances while simultaneously being divisive within the organization (Mols i Jetten, 2020). The attention should be therefore directed at the importance that leaders make in reading and shaping greivances abd public sentiment. That’s the area successful parties often proliferate at.

### 2.4 Present research

The current research focuses on the analysis of the already mentioned topics while identifying and pointing at yet different areas. Golder (2016) recognizes a multiplude of other dimensions that need to be understood to grasp dynamics behind the development of farwing politics: geographical, temporal and self-categorization aspects. Mols and Jetten (2020) build on top of it and highlight the importance of analysing the phenomenon through a combination of demand-sided and supply-sided explanations. The first includes topics like economic anxiety, inequality, immigration levels, cultural anxiety and cultural backlash. The latter is based on analysing aspects like strategic party positioning, party organization, leadership style, media messaging. What the authors highlight is the avoidance of the “eitheror” approach so commonly inhabited across studies of the phenomenon of considering only a demand-sided or supply-sided factors without considering their interconnection and interdependence.

As Golder (2016) points out a lot of research done for a particular field in understanding far right support often contradicts one another. That’s a case for an influence a position of mainstream party has on elections result- scholars came to conflicting results on whether centrist or rightist position helps RRPs grow. Yet another area of lack of consensus refers to a permissive electoral systems. Some researchers found that it helps but others concluded that it hinders far right parties success. The next topic without an agreed contribution is analysis of different stages of success. Scholars suggest that different factors affect different stages of RRPs success. Media coverage changes depending on what, when and where the party is positioned at the moment. Research shows media impacts greater in the initial phases of the development. The strength of an organization, however, plays an important role mostly in electoral consolidation and is not cricual in its inception phase. We also need to be aware of the fact that a research results can quickly be rendered incorrect following a new development. Art (2013) noted that no longer do churchgoers carry the right to victory. Polish case already in 2016 proved otherwise- the Catholic Church in Poland through varous forms of influence is an important entity influencing the political system and its environment and was an important element of political agenda for PiS (Kowalczyk, 2018). In recent decades the research has surged to explain the development and although there is now a large body of literature examining different factors, the overall results are mixed with many old assumptions being found incorrect.

Conflicting results in the literature stem from a lack of systematic approach for how to conduct a research in various fields of the topic but also from a changing subject of the matter. Both Golder (2016) and Mols and Jetten (2020) in their report point at the importance of establishing guidelines for future research. Golder (2016) also notes that progress can be made by recognition of interactions between supply and demand sided factors, geographical context of rural vs cities areas. Mols and Jetten (2020) build on the first proposal extending it as a conceptual roadmap other researchers should follow to remedy the slipping into “either or” thinking. The model showcases how factors from two sides interact and influence each other.

Currently researchers can’t fully conclude what exactly constitutes to the development of far right parties and identify a magnitude of different factors and perspectives that need to be considered. The recent surge in their support point at a need of a new approach incorporating recent advancements. The question that is rendered now is whether we can say that these parties have discovered a winning formula tailored for current times.

At the same time, the increasing digitalization of public institutions has substantially expanded both the availability and the spatial granularity of socio-economic and electoral data. In Poland, in particular, official statistics have been systematically extended in recent years, with a growing number of indicators now available for multi-year analysis at the lowest administrative level. These developments create new opportunities to empirically examine what Golder (2016) identifies as the political geography of far-right support, employing recent advances in spatial statistical methods.

## 2.5 Voting Behavior and Theoretical Frameworks

Voting behavior has been analyzed within political science through a range of theoretical frameworks that differ in their assumptions about voter motivation and the sources of political preferences. Scholars commonly distinguish between several major approaches, including behavioral, rational-choice, sociological, and economic voting models.

Behavioral approaches emphasize psychological attachments, party identification, and identity-based motivations, focusing on how long-term attitudes and group affiliations shape electoral choices. Rational-choice models conceptualize voting as a strategic decision, often operationalized through proximity or directional models, in which voters select parties closest to their ideological preferences. While these approaches have generated important insights into individual-level voting behavior, they rely heavily on attitudinal data and survey-based measurement.

In contrast, sociological and economic voting theories shift attention toward structural and contextual determinants of electoral outcomes. Sociological approaches emphasize how social position, demographic composition, and class structure shape political behavior, while economic voting theories examine how material conditions and economic performance influence electoral support. Within this tradition, scholars increasingly recognize that economic voting is not uniform but mediated by broader political and institutional contexts (Paradowski, 2017).

Building on these perspectives, recent research has highlighted the importance of spatial and contextual factors in shaping electoral outcomes. Rather than focusing exclusively on individual preferences, contextual approaches argue that voting behavior is embedded within local social, economic, and demographic environments. Political geography, in particular, emphasizes that place-based characteristics, such as settlement structure, population density, labor market conditions, and exposure to migration, can systematically influence electoral behavior independent of individual attitudes (Golder, 2016).

This thesis situates itself within this contextual and spatial tradition of voting behavior research. Rather than modeling individual-level motivations, the analysis focuses on the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of far-right party support as an outcome of locally embedded structural conditions. The explanatory variables employed in the empirical analysis capture demographic composition, economic performance, welfare exposure, migration dynamics, and settlement structure at the lowest available administrative level. By adopting a spatially explicit modeling framework, the study seeks to assess not only whether these contextual factors are associated with far-right support, but also whether such support exhibits systematic spatial dependence and persistence over time.


## Chapter 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Research Design

This thesis employs a comparative, spatially explicit research design to examine the geographical distribution and temporal dynamics of far-right party (FRP) electoral support across selected European countries. The central objective is to assess whether far-right support exhibits systematic spatial dependence, how this dependence relates to urban–rural divides, and whether spatial clustering persists or diffuses over time.

To address these questions, the study combines cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches. Spatial patterns are first examined separately for each election year to identify static spatial structures. Subsequently, a balanced panel design is employed to analyze changes in far-right support over time. This dual strategy allows for a clear distinction between spatial dependence in electoral outcomes at given points in time and potential spatial diffusion in inter-electoral dynamics.

The empirical analysis focuses on five countries—Poland, Germany, Spain, Italy, and France—selected to capture variation in party systems, institutional contexts, and trajectories of far-right mobilization while remaining comparable as consolidated European democracies.

### 3.2 Spatial Units of Analysis

The analysis is conducted at the lowest possible administrative level for which comparable electoral and socio-demographic data are available. In Poland, this corresponds to the *gmina* level. Equivalent municipal-level units are used for the remaining countries (e.g., communes, municipalities, Gemeinden).

Using fine-grained spatial units allows for the detection of localized clustering and reduces aggregation bias relative to higher-level regional analyses. However, differences in administrative structures across countries imply variation in unit size, population, and internal heterogeneity. The study therefore treats spatial patterns primarily as within-country phenomena and avoids direct comparisons of absolute effect sizes across countries.

To mitigate potential biases arising from unequal population distributions across spatial units, population-weighted robustness checks are applied in selected model specifications.

### 3.3 Data and Variables

#### 3.3.1 Dependent Variable

The primary dependent variable is far-right party support, operationalized as the percentage of valid votes cast for far-right parties in national elections. Party classification follows established definitions in the comparative far-right literature and is held constant within each country across election years if not stated otherwise.

In dynamic models, the dependent variable is additionally expressed as inter-electoral change in far-right vote share to capture temporal developments.

#### 3.3.2 Independent Variables

The independent variables capture demographic, socio-economic, and settlement-related characteristics commonly associated with far-right voting behavior:

* **Urban population share**: percentage of residents living in urban areas
* **Population density**: inhabitants per square kilometer (scaled)
* **Age structure**: percentage of the population aged 18–44
* **Electoral turnout**: percentage of eligible voters casting a ballot
* **Economic indicators**: measures of local wealth or economic well-being (subject to data availability)
* **Demographic change** (where available): population growth or decline over time

All variables are harmonized to ensure comparability within countries and across time.

### 3.4 Spatial Weights Matrix

Spatial relationships between units are modeled using a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) spatial weights matrix. This approach ensures that each spatial unit is connected to a fixed number of neighbors, which improves comparability across countries with differing geographic and administrative characteristics.

The weights matrix is row-standardized so that spatial effects can be interpreted as averages across neighboring units. Sensitivity analyses using alternative values of *k* are conducted to assess robustness.

### 3.5 Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis

Prior to model estimation, global and local measures of spatial autocorrelation are computed to assess the presence and structure of spatial clustering in far-right support.

* **Global Moran’s I** is used to test for overall spatial autocorrelation in vote shares and in inter-electoral changes.
* **Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA)** are employed to identify localized clusters and spatial outliers.

These exploratory analyses inform model selection and provide an initial assessment of hypotheses related to spatial dependence.

### 3.6 Spatial Econometric Models

#### 3.6.1 Spatial Autoregressive Model (SAR)

The Spatial Autoregressive Model incorporates spatial dependence directly into the dependent variable by including a spatial lag of far-right vote share. This specification tests whether support in one region is systematically associated with support in neighboring regions. The SAR model is primarily used to evaluate static spatial dependence at individual election points.

The spatial autoregressive (SAR) model (spatial lag model) is given by

$$
y = \rho W y + X\beta + \varepsilon
$$

- $y$ is the dependent variable vector
- $\rho$ is the spatial autoregressive parameter
- $W$ is the spatial weights matrix
- $X$ is the matrix of independent variables
- $\beta$ is the coefficient vector
- $\varepsilon$ is the error term

#### 3.6.2 Spatial Error Model (SEM)

The Spatial Error Model accounts for spatial autocorrelation arising from unobserved or omitted spatially structured factors. In this model, spatial dependence is captured in the error term rather than in the dependent variable itself. Comparing SAR and SEM results allows for differentiation between diffusion-based processes and shared contextual influences.

#### 3.6.3 Spatial Durbin Model (SDM)

The Spatial Durbin Model extends the SAR framework by including spatially lagged independent variables. This allows covariates in neighboring regions—such as demographic composition or settlement structure—to influence far-right support in a given region. The SDM provides the most flexible specification and is used to assess whether spatial dependence operates through electoral outcomes, explanatory variables, or both.

# expand the text for the formula

### 3.7 Panel Spatial Models

To analyze temporal dynamics, the study employs balanced panel spatial models with one observation per spatial unit per election year. Fixed-effects specifications are used to control for time-invariant regional characteristics. Panel models are estimated both in levels and in first differences. This approach allows for a direct comparison between spatial dependence in electoral outcomes at given points in time and spatial dependence in inter-electoral changes, thereby addressing hypotheses related to polarization and diffusion.

### 3.8 Spatial Random Forest

In addition to parametric spatial econometric models, a spatial random forest framework is employed as a complementary, non-parametric approach. Spatial information is incorporated through spatially lagged variables and neighborhood-level features. Spatial random forests are not used for formal hypothesis testing but serve to:

* capture non-linear relationships
* identify variable importance
* assess the robustness of findings under flexible functional assumptions

Results from the spatial random forest models are compared with those from spatial econometric models to evaluate consistency.

# expand the text for the formula

### 3.9 Robustness Checks and Limitations

Several robustness checks are conducted, including:

* population-weighted model specifications
* alternative kNN parameters
* subsample analyses by settlement type

Despite these measures, limitations remain due to data availability, cross-country differences in administrative structures, and the observational nature of the analysis. The results should therefore be interpreted as associational rather than causal.

### 3.10 Summary

This methodological framework combines spatial econometric modeling, panel analysis, and machine-learning techniques to provide a comprehensive examination of the spatial distribution and evolution of far-right party support. By integrating multiple approaches, the study seeks to balance interpretability, robustness, and analytical flexibility.

## 4. Spatial far right support distribution analysis

Provide background information on the most salient issue areas within each country and which ones are demand- and which supply- driven.

### 4.1 Poland

### 2019 & 2023 Parliamentary election
While there is a clear visible spatial component in both election years the evolution in between them is not spatially impacted with Moran I test confirming it. The electoral gap is very small with Far-Right parties scoring 42.54% of votes in 2023 vs 50.41% in 2019.

### notes on Poland 2023: 
1. In 2023 parliamentary elections there is a strong spatial component of voting on far right parties visible. In general the west Poland and cities tend to be more non far right leaning while the opposite is true for East and rural areas.
2. The classification to far-right parties includes PiS which had been for 2 terms a ruling party from 2015 to 2023. Considering a qualitative context of political landscape during this time reveals that PiS made and benefited from considerable changes to media coverage around political topics. In turn, PiS locked some voters to only one perspective on occurring events therefore while we see a turn to the right it is driven by media ownership very often creating the demand for right wing policies instead of reacting to voiced grievances. This leads to a need to understand how and why did support for far right parties change in places not associated to far right party support areas before 2015. Were there economic factors involved?

### 4.2 Germany
#### Important consideration before data collection process
Paradowski (2017) found that in Germany income, employment, retirement status have the most statistically significant impact on voting bevaviour. 

### 4.3 France

### 4.4 Italy

### 4.5 Spain
